    <h2>This is the place to test all the things!</h2>
    <div>
      Here I will write random things so that I can test out my git commands with merging issues & squashing commits.
    </div>
    <h3>Adding many changes so that many commits can get squashed</h3>
    <div>This is going to be a very ugly HTML page, that's okay though!</div>
